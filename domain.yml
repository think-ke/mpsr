            in movable assets.

      A security right is a property right in a moveable asset that is created by an agreement to secure payment or 
      performance of an obligation. 


      It is created by a security agreement between the grantor and the secured creditor, provided that the grantor has 
      rights in the asset to be encumbered or the power to encumber it.
